# 3D Engine

A work-in-progress 3D rendering engine built as a learning project to explore graphics programming.

# About

This project is my attempt at building a (basic) 3D engine from scratch, combining concepts from multiple sources:

- Following along primarily with [*learnopengl.com*](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials
- Planning to develop alongside what I will be learning in my computer graphics coursework
- Implementing ideas from what i've learnt from [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
- Potentially (In the long-term) work towards implementing concepts from [*Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation*](https://pbr-book.org/)

# Goals

I aim to try and work on this at least a few hours each week when i'm free, starting from completing what is covered on LearnOpenGL, as I plan to focus primarily at the moment on just getting hands-on experience with OpenGL and graphics programming fundamentals.

In the long-term (Depending on how this goes; this is already very ambitious in scale) perhaps trying to tackle topics such as physically-based rendering would be interesting.

I'm also planning to update a log (to be decided where) to track what i'm learning, the progress i'm making, and to ensure I stay on track to these goals.
