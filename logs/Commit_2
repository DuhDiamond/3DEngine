## [Commit 2] – 2026-02-17

**Time Spent:**
[3 hours] (February 16th)

### 🎯 Goals
- Follow along LearnOpenGL to implement first triangle in the "Hello Triangle" chapter

### 🛠 Accomplished
- Successfully implemented first triangle rendered on screen

### ⚠ Challenges
- Faced a few challenges regarding the lack of default error configurations (e.g. shader compilation requires to check an error code that gets returned via reference/pointer from a function)
- Overall, went much smoother than setting up the project in the first place

### 🧠 Reflections
- Prior systems programming coursework has made the syntax fairly approachable, with the ID referral system/underlying "state" system of OpenGL and error handling
- Especially seems similar (syntax-wise as well) to low-level memory management and buffers (although being able to make use of modern C++ functionality for organization)
- Should ensure I keep code organized; tutorials don't make any reference to how future code/concepts are structured, so I will need to figure out best code management practices for the project as I go

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Continue working through the "Hello Triangle" chapter and move on to "Shaders"
